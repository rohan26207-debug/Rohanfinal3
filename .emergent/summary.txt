The trajectory documents an intensely iterative and user-driven development process for the Manager Petrol Pump Calculator application. The AI engineer successfully transformed the application from a basic concept into a functionally specific tool, guided by a continuous stream of user requests. The development pattern is highly reactive, with major refactoring occurring frequently.

Key architectural shifts include:
1.  **Settings UI Evolution**: The settings functionality migrated from a main tab to a header dropdown, then evolved into a complex system of full-screen modal windows for different categories (Owner Details, Fuel Types, Employees), and was finally simplified into a compact, inline tabbed component within the dropdown itself. This involved multiple major refactors of the  component.
2.  **Feature Prototyping and Reversal**: Features like Today Stock were fully implemented on the frontend with mock data, and then completely removed upon user request, demonstrating a rapid prototyping workflow.
3.  **Mobile-Specific Bug Fixing**: A critical bug related to mobile keyboard behavior (losing focus on input fields) was diagnosed and resolved by implementing React performance optimizations (, memoized handlers) and mobile-specific input attributes.

The most recent work pivoted from UI enhancements to backend functionality, initiating a Sync with Gmail feature. This involved consulting an integration playbook and setting up the initial frontend UI, leaving the backend implementation as the immediate next task. The entire application still operates on frontend mock data, highlighting the need for a persistent backend as a major pending task.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build the M.Pump Calc, a single-page web application for managing daily petrol pump operations. The application operates entirely on the frontend with mock data, pending backend integration.

**Core Features Implemented:**
1.  **Dashboard & Summary:** A main view displays a daily financial summary (Reading Sales, Credit Sales, Income, etc.).
2.  **Date Management:** A global date selector allows users to view and manage records for any specific day.
3.  **Tabbed Interface (4 Tabs):**
    *   **Reading Sales:** Record fuel sales.
    *   **Credit Sales:** Track credit sales.
    *   **Income/Expenses:** Log other income and expenses.
    *   **Rate:** Set daily fuel prices.
4.  **Header:** Contains the app title (M.Pump Calc), a dark mode toggle, and a settings dropdown.
5.  **Inline Settings:** The settings dropdown contains an inline, tabbed interface for:
    *   **Fuel Types:** Configure fuel types and nozzle counts.
    *   **Contact:** Display static business contact information.
6.  **Daily Report Export:** A feature to export a daily report as a PDF, CSV, or copied text.

**In-Progress Feature:**
*   **Gmail Sync:** A new Sync tab is being added to the settings dropdown to allow users to sync all application data with their Gmail account. The frontend UI has been added, but the backend authentication and data transfer logic is pending.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js (functional components with Hooks like , , ).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, with components from Shadcn UI (Card, Button, Tabs, DropdownMenu).
- **Architecture:** A client-side, single-page application (SPA). State is managed in a central parent component () and passed down via props (prop drilling).
- **Data:** All application data is currently mocked using static JavaScript objects and arrays within the components.
- **Third-Party Integrations:**  for PDF generation and  for Google OAuth2.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a frontend-only React application. All UI, logic, and state management are contained within the  directory.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the main application component. It serves as the root for the user interface, holds all application state (sales, credit, expenses, settings), manages the active tab, and contains the logic for financial calculations and data exports (PDF, CSV).
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file was modified to add and subsequently remove the Today Stock feature, which involved changing the tab structure and managing stock data state. Its current state reflects a 4-tab layout (Reading Sales, Credit Sales, Income/Expenses, Rate).

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This component manages all application settings through a dropdown menu in the header. It has undergone the most significant refactoring throughout the development process.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file evolved dramatically. It started as a simple dropdown, was refactored to launch full-screen modal windows for different settings (Owner Details, Employees, Fuel Types), and was then refactored again to its current state. The latest change was to add a new Sync tab with a Sync with Google button placeholder, initiating the Gmail integration feature.

    **Current JSX for the Settings Dropdown:**

<pending_tasks>
- **Backend Implementation:** The entire application currently runs on mock, non-persistent data. A full backend with a database (e.g., MongoDB) and REST APIs is required to make the application production-ready.
- **Complete Gmail Sync:** Finalize the Gmail integration. This requires creating backend endpoints for Google OAuth2 authentication and implementing the data synchronization logic.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was to begin implementing a Sync with Gmail feature. The user requested a new Sync tab within the settings dropdown to connect to a real Gmail account and sync all application data.

The AI engineer initiated this task by:
1.  Invoking the  agent to get the correct procedure for Google API integration, which recommended using the  library for OAuth2.
2.  Installing the  Python library.
3.  Modifying the frontend component  to add the new Sync tab to the settings interface.
4.  Adding a placeholder UI within the Sync tab, which includes a Sync with Google button.

The work has paused at this point. The frontend UI is in place, but the backend logic required to handle the authentication request from this button has not yet been created. The immediate next step involves building the backend endpoints for the OAuth2 flow.

<optional_next_step>
Create the backend endpoints ( and ) to handle the Google OAuth2 flow initiated by the new Sync with Google button on the frontend, following the provided integration playbook.
