The trajectory documents a highly reactive development process driven by three major user-initiated pivots. The initial task was to connect the existing React frontend (M.Pump Calc) to its FastAPI backend for data persistence. This was successfully implemented, including creating API services, refactoring the main component to handle API calls, and passing backend tests. However, a user request to not able to save price revealed an authentication issue, which was correctly diagnosed.

Immediately following this, the user's requirements shifted dramatically. First, they requested the app work in offline mode only, leading to a complete architectural refactoring. All backend integration and authentication logic were stripped out and replaced with a browser  service for data persistence. This involved significant changes to the main component and its children.

Finally, after the offline version was implemented but still had minor UI bugs, the user requested the application be converted into a native Android app (.apk). This initiated the third major phase: creating a new React Native project from scratch. The AI began scaffolding the mobile app, creating new components and a mobile-specific storage service. The process is currently stalled due to repeated failures in setting up the complex Android build environment (Java, SDK, Gradle). The user's last request was to remove specific branding.

<product_requirements>
The product, M.Pump Calc, is a utility designed for managing the daily financial operations of a petrol pump, including fuel sales, credit sales, income, and expenses.

The project began as a single-page web application with a feature-rich UI and data export capabilities (PDF, CSV, Text). The initial goal was to enable online data persistence by connecting the React frontend to an existing FastAPI backend with Google OAuth for syncing.

However, user requirements pivoted the project to become a fully **offline-first web application**. This change removed all dependencies on a backend, server, or internet connection, storing all user data securely in the browser's .

The final and current requirement is to convert this offline web application into a **native Android app**, which can be distributed and installed as an APK file. The core functionality of offline data management must be preserved in the mobile version.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend (Web):** React.js, Functional Components, Hooks (, ), Tailwind CSS.
- **Frontend (Mobile):** React Native for Android app conversion.
- **Data Persistence:**
    - Initially: FastAPI/MongoDB (Implemented but then removed).
    - Currently (Web): Browser  API.
    - Currently (Mobile):  for React Native.
- **Build Tooling:** yarn install v1.22.22

<code_architecture>
The codebase is now split into two main projects: the original web application and the new mobile application.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This was the core monolithic component for the web application. It was heavily refactored twice: first to integrate backend APIs, and then again to use the  service for offline mode.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** All state management and data handling functions were modified to read from and write to . API-related logic, loading states, and error handling for network requests were removed.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This service was created to abstract all interactions with the browser's . It handles initializing, fetching, and saving all application data (sales, credits, rates, etc.), making the web app fully functional offline.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Created as a new file to replace the backend API service.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The root component of the React web app.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** The  context wrapper was removed from this file to eliminate residual authentication checks and API calls after the pivot to offline mode.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This directory contains the new, in-progress React Native project for the native Android app.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This entire directory was newly created. It includes scaffolded components (, , etc.) and a  designed to use React Native's  as a replacement for the web's . The project is not yet buildable.

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Native App Conversion:** The primary task is to successfully build the React Native project () into a functional APK. This requires resolving the ongoing issues with the Android build environment (installing , configuring the Android SDK, and successfully running Gradle).
- **Remove Branding:** Address the user's most recent request to remove Made with Emergent branding from the mobile application.
- **Implement UI/Logic:** Port the UI and business logic from the React web components to the new React Native components.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is in the middle of a basic conversion of the M.Pump Calc web application into a native Android app using React Native, as per the user's request for an APK file.

A new React Native project has been initialized at . The engineer has scaffolded several basic screen components (, , etc.) and created a mobile-specific storage service () that uses .

The entire process is currently blocked by failures in setting up the Android build environment. The AI has attempted to install Java and the Android SDK but has run into a series of configuration and dependency issues:
-    environment variable not being set correctly.
-   Gradle build failures due to a missing  file (indicating an incomplete SDK setup).
-   The  command was not found, preventing the downloaded Android command-line tools from being installed.

The last action taken was an attempt to install the  package. The user's most recent request was to Remove made with emergent, which has not been acted upon yet. The mobile app is currently in a non-buildable, non-functional state.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
First, address the user's immediate request by searching for and removing any Made with Emergent branding within the  directory.
