# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ROOT CAUSE: The exportToPDF function's window.open() call is not executing when triggered by button click, possibly due to: - Event handler not properly bound to button, - JavaScript error preventing execution, - Browser security restrictions on programmatic window.open(), - React event handling issues. RECOMMENDATION: Debug the button click handler and ensure exportToPDF function is properly called when Print/PDF button is clicked."

      message: "❌ ENHANCED PRINT/PDF FUNCTIONALITY TESTING RESULTS: Tested the enhanced Print/PDF functionality with in-preview printing capability as requested. CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: 1) ✅ Print/PDF button is visible and clickable in Export Daily Report section, 2) ❌ Preview window does NOT open when Print/PDF button is clicked - window.open() call is failing, 3) ❌ No new window/tab opens despite button click being registered, 4) ✅ Manual JavaScript execution of PDF export function works correctly and creates preview window with proper content including Daily Report title, date, SUMMARY section, and '🖨️ Print / Save as PDF' button, 5) ❌ Actual button click handler is not triggering window.open() properly. ROOT CAUSE: The exportToPDF function's window.open() call is not executing when triggered by button click, possibly due to: Event handler not properly bound to button, JavaScript error preventing execution, Browser security restrictions on programmatic window.open(), or React event handling issues. RECOMMENDATION: Debug the button click handler and ensure exportToPDF function is properly called when Print/PDF button is clicked. The enhanced functionality code exists but the button integration is broken."

      message: "🔧 EDIT FUNCTIONALITY COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: Tested all edit scenarios as requested by user. DETAILED RESULTS: ✅ CREDIT SALES EDIT: Working perfectly - successfully added credit record (John Doe, Diesel, ₹897.50), clicked edit button (pencil icon), form entered edit mode showing 'Update Credit' button, modified customer name from 'John Doe' to 'Jane Smith', saved changes successfully with proper UI update and success toast. ❌ READING SALES EDIT: Partially working - successfully added sale record (P1, Petrol, 1000-1020, ₹2050.00), edit buttons (pencil icons) are visible in records list, but clicking edit button did not activate edit mode in form. ✅ INCOME/EXPENSES EDIT: Records added successfully (Income: ₹500 'Bonus payment', Expense: ₹200 'Office supplies'), edit buttons visible in both Income and Expense record sections, but edit mode activation needs investigation. ✅ NO 'EDIT NOT SUPPORTED' ERRORS: Confirmed no error messages appear during testing - no 'Edit Not Supported' errors found anywhere in the application. ✅ EDIT BUTTONS PRESENT: All tabs (Reading Sales, Credit Sales, Inc./Exp.) have visible edit buttons (pencil icons) in their respective record lists. ✅ EDIT CANCELLATION: Cancel functionality available in Credit Sales with proper form reset when Cancel button clicked. SUMMARY: Credit Sales edit functionality working perfectly with complete edit workflow. Reading Sales and Income/Expenses have edit buttons present but edit mode activation is inconsistent. Core edit infrastructure is implemented and functional, but needs debugging for Reading Sales and Income/Expenses tabs."
